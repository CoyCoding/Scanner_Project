# Scanner_Project
A first build of my mock scanner system taking input from user. (Java)<br />
No where near complete but posted to show progress.<br />
<br />

V.2 up now this version every "location" extends location and thus the code is clean. and presise.<br />
This model is very close to the structure of what the final build would be.<br />
The old is left in A_Scanner as some of the logic/methods are to be repurposed.<br />
----------<br />
My goal (part 1) : COMPLETE <br />
*
<br />*
<br />
GOAL (part 2) :
Okay goal part 2 was accomplished. All locations now extend location; however, I left behind the "display class" as I feel it needs completely reworked around the new correct programming structure. So although goal 2 was reached I want eveything that was removed from the original to be functioning again first.
<br />
<br />
(part 3)<br />
 I had move methods / load methods / and undload methods done but building them again should be easy working my way forward.<br />
